# K-Means Clustering of Interests: Grouping Individuals by Preferences

Welcome to the **K-Means Clustering of Interests** project! This repository demonstrates the power of unsupervised learning to group individuals based on their unique interests. The goal is to apply the **K-Means clustering** algorithm to cluster people based on their preferences, then aggregate the results by group for further insights.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project uses the **K-Means clustering algorithm** to segment individuals into different groups based on their interests. After clustering, the individuals are grouped into clusters, and the total interests for each group are computed and summarized.

### Why is this important?
Understanding the clustering of individuals based on interests can lead to improved recommendations, better customer segmentation, and insights into common patterns across various groups. This can be highly beneficial for businesses, marketing, or social research.

## 📊 Dataset Overview

The dataset contains information on **individuals' interests**, including:
- **group**: Represents different groups of individuals.
- **grand_tot_interests**: The sum of interests for each individual.

We apply K-Means clustering to this dataset to understand how individuals can be grouped by their preferences.

### Data Columns
- **group**: Group label for each individual (e.g., Age, Region, etc.).
- **grand_tot_interests**: Total number of interests per individual.

## 🛠️ Steps to Build the Model

### 1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - **Handling Missing Values**: Missing data is imputed with a default value (0), assuming no interest where values are missing.
   - **Standardization**: Standardize the dataset to ensure that all features contribute equally to the clustering.

### 2. **Clustering with K-Means**
   - **Model Training**: We use the **K-Means** algorithm to segment individuals into different clusters (5 clusters are used by default).
   - **Cluster Assignment**: After training the model, individuals are assigned to clusters based on their interests.

### 3. **Aggregating Group Data**
   - **Summarization**: The results are grouped by the group column, and the total grand_tot_interests are summed for each group to observe the aggregated interests per group.

### 4. **Final Output**
   - The final output is a table displaying each group and the sum of their total interests. This table is a key insight into how interests are distributed across various groups.

### Example Output:

| Group | Total Interests |
|-------|-----------------|
| A     | 30              |
| B     | 20              |
| C     | 25              |

## 📈 Visualizations

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python installed on your machine. Then, install the necessary libraries using pip:

## Expected Output:
A table displaying the summed interests per group in your terminal.
Optionally, a CSV file of the summarized results.

## 🔍 Results & Insights
This project produces a detailed table that shows how individual interests are clustered and how they are distributed across different groups. By examining these clusters, you can:

  - Discover common interests within specific groups.
  - Generate targeted insights based on group preferences.
  - Use these insights to enhance personalization, marketing strategies, or further research.
### 🎯 Usage
-This project can be used for:

  - Customer Segmentation: Grouping customers based on common preferences.
  - Market Research: Understanding the distribution of interests across different demographics.
  - Recommendation Systems: Building personalized systems by understanding the clustering of interests.
